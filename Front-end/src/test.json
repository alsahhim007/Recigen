                    "Although the body needs salt to survive, most of us get too much. The problem with consuming too much salt (what chemists call \"sodium chloride\") is actually the <a href=\"https://spoonacular.com/academy/sodium\">sodium</a> part, which is why people concerned about high blood pressure go on low-sodium diets. If you are trying to reduce salt in your diet, you can try salt substitutes like potassium chloride or try to make do with less salt by using more black pepper, herbs, and spices."

                    "If you're using olive oil to cook at high temperatures, make sure that the olive oil you're using has a high smoke point because heating an oil past its smoke point can ruin the flavor and even release harmful compounds into your dish. Many people recommend saving extra-virgin olive oil for cold dishes or for adding the finishing touch to a warm dish. You could also use canola oil, coconut oil, or another good <a href=\"https://spoonacular.com/academy/vegetable-oil\">high-temperature oil</a> to be on the safe side.",
                    "If you've never made quinoa before, be sure to rinse it well before you prepare it. The easiest way is to put it in a fine-mesh strainer and run water over it from the sink. Skipping this step could result in bitter, even soapy tasting quinoa because quinoa's natural coating tastes pretty bad. Quinoa sold in supermarkets is often pre-rinsed, but its better to be safe than sorry, right?",
                    "Maple syrup comes in three grades, either A-C or 1-3 depending on where you live. To learn which types are suitable for which uses in the kitchen, check out our lesson on <a href=\"https://spoonacular.com/academy/maple-syrup\">maple syrup</a> in the academy.",
                    "Like many ground spices, ground nutmeg loses its flavor over time. For the best nutmeg taste, purchase whole nutmeg and grate it right as you use it. If you're a real nutmeg lover, you can even buy a nutmeg grinder. ",
                    "If your recipe calls for ripe bananas and you only have green ones, stick the green bananas in a closed paper bag to speed up the ripening process. You can even put an apple in the bag with them since apples produce a lot of the gas that encourages ripening (called ethylene). This process takes some time, of course, so if you need ripe bananas immediately you might give the <a href=\"http://lifehacker.com/5921005/quickly-ripen-bananas-for-baking-and-smoothies-in-the-oven\">oven method</a> a try.",
                    "There are two types of cinnamon. The more expensive and rarer type is Ceylon cinnamon (considered to be \"true cinnamon\"). The cinnamon most common in North America is cassia cinnamon. Though the flavor is certainly similar, Ceylon cinnamon is said to be more subtle yet also more complex."

However, its minimal processing could also mean it has a lower smoke point than other olive oils. Once an oil starts to smoke, it begins to break down, producing a bad flavor and potentially harmful compounds. Unfortunately, the smoke point of an oil depends on so many factors that it is hard to say what the smoke point of an oil really is. For extra-virgin olive oil, it could be anywhere between 200-400 degrees Fahrenheit. Most people recommend using extra-virgin olive oil to add flavor to a finished dish or in cold dishes to be on the safe side. More refined olive oils, canola oil,  coconut oil, and <a href=\"https://spoonacular.com/academy/butter\">clarified butter/ghee</a> are better options for high temperature cooking."
